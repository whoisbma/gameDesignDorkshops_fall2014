#Game Design Dorkshops - Fall 2014
=================================

Each game design/development dorkshop introduces a new classic game to deconstruct, understand, and recreate from the ground up in Processing. 

We are using no game engines, no physics for collision detection, no shortcuts - we're writing basic stuff ourselves to gain a better appreciation for technical limitations and better insight into how these things really work, while understanding how to better structure systems in code.
